# Contributing to the project

So you want to know how you can help?? You've come to the right place!
Below you will find many ways you can help.
First and foremost check the TODO's to see what needs to be done.
Once you're ready to start programming see the Programming Standards section.

### TODO's
- [X] Create basic class for a card
- [ ] Figure out a way to quickly generate unique cards with abilities
- [ ] Create a card list for the first set
- [ ] Create set class that will hold data for the cards to generate from

### Pull Request

For something to be considered for merging in to master it must be 
submitted as a Pull Request to development first. All Pull Requests 
will be given at least 24 hours before being merged in to the 
development branch. Pull requests may take longer to be merged if more 
needs to change. On every monday the development branch will have a pull 
request made to be merged in to the master repository. This pull request 
will sit for one week to be reviewed until it is merged in on Sunday. 
The weekly pull request may be delayed if more changes need to be made.
